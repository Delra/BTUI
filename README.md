# BTUI
A Mudlet UI for BTMUX, as well as some basic keybinds to get you going!

## What is Mudlet? 
Mudlet is a free and open-source program for connecting to MU*s. You can find it [here](https://mudlet.org/download) for any platform!

## What is BTMUX?
BTMUX is a type of MU* - a MUX, or Multi-User Experience - that seeks to replicate the Battletech game and universe closely, but with a few improvements and compromises for the real-time format. If you like big mechs, I recommend giving it a go!
 - mekcity.com port 3067
 - btmux.com port 3065

## How do I install this thing?
If you have decided you'd like to enhance your BTMUX experience, you've come to the right place. Just
 - [click this link](https://github.com/Delra/BTUI/releases) to go to the latest release of our code, download the `btui.mpackage` file, and you're already halfway there!
 - [go here](https://mudlet.org/download) and install the latest version of Mudlet
 - In the Connect dialog, click "New" to make a new profile, and choose one of the games above to play, putting the relevant address in the Address: field and the port in the Port: field, after giving it a clever name (like MekCity, or BTMUX). Then, hit connect! 
 - Once you're connected, go into the Module Manager (click the arrow just to the right of the Package Manager button, along the top of your screen, to open a drop down), click 'install', and find the btui.mpackage you downloaded earlier. 
 - **DO NOT CLICK SYNC.** You're done! 


## Okay... now what?
Now, let's go over some really important keybindings that are in place for you.

### General
 - CTRL+H: This enables and disables the HUD updating and all that fancy stuff - you'll want to make sure to save this until you're in a mech. Once you pop this off, it'll load some basic information. Hitting it again will reset everything and turn off the updates, until the next time you press the button.

### Piloting
Movement
 - NUM1-4, 6-9 will determine your heading in an intuitive way; 8 is 0 (or north), 6 is 90 (or east), so on and so forth.
 - NUM0, NUM., and NUMenter will let you set your speed (slow, walk, run). CTRL+NUM0 will let you set your speed to _reverse_.

Combat
 - ALT+NUM4-6 will let you twist your torso: left, center, and right, respectively.
 - NUM/, NUM*, and NUM- wil let you firetic 0, 1, and 2 respectively.
